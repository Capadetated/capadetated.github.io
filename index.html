          <p>
          I’m thrilled to connect with you! My journey as an analytical biochemist has been anything but ordinary. From my early days as an undergraduate researcher at the <a href="https://cms.ctahr.hawaii.edu/mbbe/">University of Hawai'i</a>, where I characterized Conus toxins to explore their potential as drug candidates, I’ve been captivated by the intersection of science and problem-solving. This fascination led me to roles at leading companies like Takeda and Amgen, where I’ve honed my skills.
          </p>
          <p>
          Currently serving as an Digital Delivery Manager at <a href="https://www.takeda.com/en-us/">Takeda</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts, I thrive on tackling complex issues head-on. Throughout my tenure at Takeda, I’ve transitioned from an Associate Scientist to Lead Particle Lab US to Analytical Compliance Manager before stepping into my current position. Each role taught me the importance of collaboration across teams; whether I performed bench work in the lab or developed SOPs for new processes - I've always aimed to deliver clear results.
          </p>
          <p>
          I believe strongly in the power of continuous learning. I earned my Master’s degree in Data Analytics from <a href="https://www.umgc.edu/online-degrees/masters/data-analytics">University of Maryland</a> because I'm excited about how data can drive decision-making in our field. My analytical mindset goes beyond just crunching numbers; it's about understanding what those numbers mean for our projects, products, and ultimately for patients.
          </p>
          <p>
          Outside of work, you’ll often find me on a mountain trail or grappling on the mats practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu - both teach me resilience and strategy that I apply to my professional life every day. Volunteering also holds a special place in my heart; giving back enriches my perspective on teamwork and community.
          </p>
